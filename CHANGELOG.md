# Change Log

## 1.2.0 (May 12, 2017)

 - Add support for nested hosts configurations
 - Add more verbose hosts-file comments in the output
 - Sort methods by name
 - Remove recommendation to symlink to `/usr/local/bin` since
   the script is to support configurations from multiple users.
 - Updated all the readme files to reflect the new nested-config option.

## 1.1.0 (May 8, 2017)

 - Update README for the package to include an index
 - Update README for plugins to add an index
   and add an uninstall section.
 - Now the `Apache Hosts Export` plugin uses the same
   version as the `Hosts Manager` package. This was done
   because the plugin is available out-of-the-box as part
   of the package any way, so it doesn't make sense to
   maintain two semvers.

## 1.0.0 (May 7, 2017)

 - Initial release
